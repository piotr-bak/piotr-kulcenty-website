This is a portfolio website showcasing works of Piotr Kulcenty, violin maker and instrument restorer based in London.
The design was created by [Mariana Alcobia](https://marianaalcobia.com/) from Construct London design studio.
Image-centric design and Client's desire for highest image quality possible required a high level of performance optimization (to keep loading times and Google Lighthouse score on the happy side). 

This website is also a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
