# Piotr Kulcenty Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website showcasing works of Piotr Kulcenty, violin maker and instrument restorer based in London.
The design was created by [Mariana Alcobia](https://marianaalcobia.com/) from Construct London design studio.

## Why is it here?
Because "there's more here than meets the eye". Image-centric design, the requirement for a pixel-perfect implementation as well as the Client's desire for highest image quality possible turned into a journey in search of every possible performance optimization.
Everything is there: pre-loads, lazy-loads, predicting user actions - all in order to keep loading times and Google Lighthouse score on the happy side.
The design is modular and crafted with future extension in mind. Despite looking deceptively simple, almost every element of the interface can be customized and new elements (such as new instruments in the gallery) can be added virtually without effort. 

This website is also a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to check it out on your own machine?

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
